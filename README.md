# Netflix Hero Section Prototype

This project demonstrates a **Netflix Hero Section** design prototype created using **Figma**. The prototype showcases a visually rich hero section layout similar to Netflix's homepage, featuring a background image, a call-to-action (CTA) button, and a smooth interaction for showcasing content or a featured movie/TV show.

The goal of this project is to practice UI/UX design by replicating a popular design pattern and implementing interactive elements such as hover effects, buttons, and text animations.
